TODO:





make local_* versions of the field writer methods and make the plain versions write through update as well
update should return a future that can take multiple on_success / on_failure / on_complete handleres
default handler is on_complete, which takes a boolean value for success (is this really needed?)

implement RemoteDomain#insert
put #insert on relations generally
same api for success/failure

work out error reporting api

[ ] remove inflector extensions on string prototype and use Inflector.X directly instead in library code
[ ] integrate into mmol
[ ] performance testing
