TODO:
[*] factor out relation commonalities
[*] domain object
[*] merge domain snapshot (our equivalent of execute server commands)
[ ] implement Domain#make_global which adds all its sets as global names on window and use this in spec helper
[ ] use name provided in the #define_set api to configure the global name of the created set. this could probably be moved to the Set's constructor params 
[ ] integrate into mmol
[ ] performance testing
[ ] domain object / global domain
[ ] remote repository proxy
