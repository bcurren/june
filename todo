TODO:

add FakeRemoteDomain and install it by default in tests
make set_field_value call update on Origin, and add a local_set_field_value which is used by local_update

add forms to the content editor. have the form#save call update on its underlying tuple with the all field values rather than setting them one at a time

update should return a future that can take multiple on_success / on_failure / on_complete handlers
default handler is on_complete, which takes a boolean value for success (is this really needed?)



implement RemoteDomain#insert
put #insert on relations generally
same api for success/failure

add a create button to all the lists which creates an empty object

do a drag/drop interface for moving questions between sets?
